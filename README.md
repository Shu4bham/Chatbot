# Chatbot
Welcome to the Android Chatbot App repository! This repository contains the source code for an Android chatbot application built in Java. The chatbot in this app is powered by the Brainshop API, which allows you to integrate a chatbot into your Android application.

You will need an API key from Brainshop to use the chatbot service. You can obtain an API key by signing up on the Brainshop website.

Place the API in mainactivity.java file with your actual Brainshop API key.

# Build and Run
Now that you have inserted your API key, you can build and run the Android Chatbot App using Android Studio. Connect your Android device or use an emulator to test the app.
